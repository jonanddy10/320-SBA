# Weather App Pro +

## This project is local weather app for Seattle created using React.

### This basic react application will provide the current temperature in Seattle (F). Upon clicking on the 'Hourly' or 'Weekly' forecast option a 'new' page will display the associated data.

## Future updates

### In the future I will add the ability to search by city name and display an entire day forecast as will as a possible 3-day forcast

### NOTICE: THIS PROJECT UTULIZES THE OPENWEATHER API AND USES THE LOCATION OF SEATTLE AS THE DEFAULT SETTING. CUSTOM LOCATIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN FUTURE UPDATES.
